### The Data Science process

Iterative process that starts with a question, risen from business needs and understanding.

### What is modeling?

Modeling is a cycle of data and business understanding. You start by exploring your assets, in this case data, with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, from that point feature engineering starts and finally train a model on top, which is an algorithm that learns information and provides a probabilistic prediction.

In the end, the model is evaluated to check where it is accurate and where it is failing to correct the behavior.

### Choose a use case

Identify the problem (business understanding) -> Define the project goals -> Identify data sources

### Data preparation

Data cleansing and EDA are vital to the modeling process, to get insights on what data is or is not useful and what needs to be corrected or taken into account. Understanding the data is one of the most vital steps in the data science cycle.

### Feature engineering

What extra knowledge we can extract by combining existing features to create new ones.

### Model training

Split data -> Cross-validate data -> Obtain probabilistic prediction

### Model evaluation

**Hyperparameters** are parameters used in model training that cannot be learned by the training process. These parameters must be set before model training begins.

For evaluating the results you need to set up a metric to compare different runs, such as accuracy or MSE.

### Model deployment

Model deployment is the final stage of the data science procedure. It is often done by a developer, and is usually not part of the data scientist role.

### Specialized roles in the Data Science process

In the data science process, there are specialists in each of the steps:

Business Analyst or Domain Expert, Data Engineer, Developer and Data Scientist.

1. The Model deployment involves.

* Calling a model to score new data.
* Training a model.
* Copying a trained model and its code dependencies to an environment where it will be used to score new data.
